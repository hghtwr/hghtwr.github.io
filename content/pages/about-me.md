About Me
========

I'm Johannes ðŸ‘‹.

If you think about software developers as factory workers building a car, I'm the one helping to build the factory. I develop the necessary tools the developer need, put different combinations of these tools together, make sure they know where the tools are and how to use them. Blueprints I create help the developers to create new factory lines quickly and with the press of a button. I also make sure the factory doesn't burn down, keeps running and is secure.

Obviously, nothing great has ever been achieved alone. That's why I dedicate a lot of my time to improve what the team I'm part of does and how it's done.
Diving into interesting aspects of remote work, behavioral aspects and how to make work better keeps me going.

I work from home and like solving problems makes me forgot the time. Thankfully, my furry friend reminds me regularly to take him out for a walk.
I love to play music and do sports, love waking up fresh & rested but hate to go to sleep and I enjoy being busy more than doing nothing.
