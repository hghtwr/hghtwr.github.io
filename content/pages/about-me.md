About Me
========

I'm Johannes, a platform engineer.

If you think about software developers as factory workers building a car, I'm the one building the factory. I develop the necessary tools the developer need, put different combinations of these tools together, make sure they know where the tools are and how to use them. Blueprints I create help the developers to create new factory lines quickly and with the press of a button. I also make sure the factory doesn't burn down, keeps running and is secure.

I like working from home and solving problems makes me forgot the time. Thankfully, my furry friend reminds me regularly to take him out for a walk.

I have a lovely wife, love to play music and do sports, love waking up fresh & rested but hate to go to sleep and I enjoy being busy more than doing nothing.
